# Aquinas Daily
Welcome to Aquinas Daily. This is a small app that houses St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica (i.e., the Summa) to enable a few basic functions.

1. Explore.

2. Search.

3. Learn.


By offering the entire <em>summa</em> with dropdown menus, one can readily explore the text specifically. In addition, there is an option to search, using simple keyword matching. Throughout this process, topic modeling will enable rapid high level grapsing of the concepts of interest. Lastly, a curration of all of St. Thomas' reference to Aristotle have been mined and codified into the <em>readers</em> supplied in the last page. Happy studies in Aquinas!
